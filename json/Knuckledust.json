                "Bron into stress and confusion, to see such pain from when my eyes were so young. My heart bled, the darkest red fluidly, cold struggle never let us feel true unity. To my father dead and gone, Rest In Peace, you gave me more than you'll ever know. Para siempre hasta la muerte. Me daste la fuerza y por LBU soy frerte. 'Till my time comes, I'll struggle insanely, help my bloods get where they need to be. Respect my brothers, respect my sisters who gave me strenght through the darkest seasons. Caught between heartbreak and happiness, got to build more bridge and break more wall. Change pain into faith, learn to get up after every fall. It's no easy road to travel, when your heart's in such trouble. You look around, you look around, youre all alone. If this life burns you in your heart, then you feel our true fucking pain. Every child, woman, man in the struggle, never falter, neve fade away. Stand strong and responsible. Stand hard and the weight of this world won't bring you down. You are not alone"
